# AlgorithmicToolbox

This repository contains the projects and assignments that I have completed as part of **Data Structure and Algorithm** course offered by **University of California San Diego**

It covers essential algorithmic techniques and ideas for solving computational problems that arise frequently in practical applications. The course is designed to provide a solid foundation in algorithm design and analysis, and to develop the skills necessary to solve complex problems efficiently and reliably.
The course covers the fundamentals of computer science and programming, with a focus on data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.
